<h2>Terms of Use</h2><p>My Health Summary is a system intended to let you gather, organize, and share your health information from health care providers, government sources, and information you may wish to contribute to your record. You might want to do this when you are getting care from different providers who may not share electronic health records, if you need to verify immunizations or summarize traveler health information, if you need urgent or emergency care, or if you wishto share your health history with family, caregivers, or others.</p><p>In simple terms: we treat your health information as yours. We don’t sell it or intentionally share it. We use it only to run the system. While we take security seriously, you should decide carefully what you choose to upload. You can delete the information you upload, but we have not implemented the complete ability for you to specify that your use of the system “be forgotten”, and we may not be able to do so for reasons of security and data integrity. Please read and agree to the details below:</p><p>This version of My Health Summary is hosted and operated as a research project by the Clinical Informatics Research Group at the University of Washington. Our research is not about you or your health data, but is on the technical methods of using data standards to implement individually-controlled data gathering and sharing. We do not intend to deliberately share your data, or to look at your data for reasons other than technical tasks to keep the system secure or improve its functionality.</p><!--start Production Version Only--><p>This “live” system can help you access and create or update your real health data, using your rights as a patient under the US 21st Century Cures Act, and so it is important that you agree to the following:</p><p>“You understand that using this system is entirely at your own risk. Your understand that it is developed and maintained on a best-effort basis, and that no person or organization guarantees that the system, or the data you may store in it, is private, secure, or reliable, and that there is no assurance of that the data are accurate in the system, or that the system will be operating and available at any particular time.”</p><!--end Production Version Only--><p>If you choose to use this system, the following sections describe both our intent, and provide specific cautions:</p><h3>System Availability</h3><p>It is our intent to provide a system which is highly reliable and available when needed, both for the gathering and creation of health summaries and for the ongoing sharing of those summaries. Our intent is that the system be available 24 hours a day/7 days a week. We intend to develop and share statistics on system availability which you may wish to consider in choosing whether or not to use this system. However, all efforts are on a best efforts basis.</p><h3>User Content and Responsibility</h3><p>Users may upload, store, or input health-related information (“User Health Data”) into the system. Users are solely responsible for the accuracy, completeness, legality, and appropriateness of any User Health Data they provide. The system does not verify, validate, or independently review such information.</p><h3>No Medical Advice or Services</h3><p>The system is provided for informational and organizational purposes only. It does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or clinical decision-making. Use of the system does not create a patient-provider relationship or any fiduciary or professional duty.</p><h3>Data Sharing</h3><p>User Health Data is accessible only to the user, to system processes necessary for core functionality (e.g., storage, retrieval, generation and sharing of summaries, backup, and security monitoring), and to those individuals with whom the user elects to share their health information by sharing a link or QR code. We are not responsible for any data sharing done by the user through these or any other mechanisms. </p><h3>No Deliberate Sharing of Health Information</h3><p>We do not intentionally sell, rent, trade, or publicly disclose User Health Data to third parties. User Health Data is not shared for advertising or marketing purposes.</p><h3>Permitted Disclosures</h3><p>User Health Data may be accessed or disclosed only in the following limited circumstances:</p><ul><li>At the user’s explicit direction or consent</li><li>To operate, maintain, enhance or secure the system</li><li>If required by applicable law, regulation, or legal process</li><li>To protect the rights, safety, or integrity of the system or its users</li></ul><h3>Security Practices</h3><p>Reasonable technical and organizational measures are used to protect User Health Data against unauthorized access. However, no system can be guaranteed to be completely secure, and users acknowledge that they upload or create and modify all User Health Data at their own risk.</p><h3>No Guarantee of Confidentiality</h3><p>While the system is designed to limit access to User Health Data, we do not guarantee absolute confidentiality or immunity from unauthorized access.</p><h3>User Control</h3><p>Users may delete their uploaded health information at any time through available system functionality. Deleted data may persist temporarily in backups or logs before being permanently removed. We intend to implement a “right to be forgotten”, which we interpret as your right to have all of your health data, account data, and log data deleted, however this is technically challenging and is not implemented in the current system functionality. If you live in a jurisdiction that requires the “right to be forgotten”, you cannot use the system.</p><h3>Not a Covered Entity</h3><p>The system is not a “covered entity” or “business associate” under HIPAA or similar health privacy laws unless expressly stated otherwise. Users acknowledge that their data may not be subject to protections applicable to regulated healthcare providers or insurers.</p><h3>Limitation of Responsibility</h3><p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, or disclosure of User Health Data, except where caused by willful misconduct.</p><h3>Informed Consent</h3><p>By clicking "I Accept", you acknowledge that you understand the nature of the system, its limitations, and the data practices described in these Terms, and consent to the collection, storage, and processing of your information as described.</p>
