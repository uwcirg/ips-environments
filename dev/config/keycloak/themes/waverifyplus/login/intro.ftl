		<p>Welcome to WA Health Summary, a free tool being developed by the WA State Department of Health (DOH)
			that can be used to build your health summary and share that summary as you see fit, under your
			control. You might want to have a summary for emergency use, to share with new providers, to
			have a complete immunization record, or to use with personal health applications that are now
			emerging. The health summary can use computerized health record data from your health care
			providers (which the US Federal 21st Century Cures Act gives you the right to do), information
			such as advance directives and occupational health which choose to enter and share, and some
			information from WA State DOH, such as your immunization data. You choose what and how you
			share. You can create different summaries for different purposes, give them expiration dates,
			and attach passcodes, if you wish. Each summary you create will have its own internet link and
			QR code.
		</p>
		<p>Enter your information below to verify your identity and create a WA Health Summary account. Your
			information will be checked against the WA State Immunization Registry data. In the event that
			it does not match, or you have not received immunizations in Washington State, you will not be
			able to use WA Health Summary at this time.</p>
